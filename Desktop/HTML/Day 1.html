<h2> What I like. </h2>
<p> I am huge fan of machines more specifically robots. Besides factory robots, Autobots are realy cool but I have this thing for jaegers. I think they are pretty awesome. The idea that a machine that size could actually exist is something that I find very interesting. The best part is that human beings get to participate in thei manufacure and actual operation. If it was an option, i would really want to be a jaeger pilot. I know you're thinking this is fiction anyway but I know they exist. Germans are really smart yet secretive people. You never know what they might be cooking up in their really cool labs. Either that or the person who imagined jaegers has the best imagination. I want to be his friend. </p>
<h2> What I don't like. </h2>
<p> I am not a fan of animals. I mean yeah, some are soft and cuddly but the fact that the are not human and cannot think like we do which would make them understand that I dont like them therefore keep away from me is what pisses me off most. I do like Siberian Huskies though. They are pretty cool. That's a dog I would keep.</p>
